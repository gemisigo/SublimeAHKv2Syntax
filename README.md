### ***This is a work in progress. There are most likely some situations in which the highlighting is broken. I've improved it enough for myself to use it comfortably and it's very rare I run into anything but I do run into issues occasionally, which I'll fix. The biggest issue with this syntax definition, which is arguably not much of an issue depending on the color scheme you're using, is that many color schemes just don't support enough syntax tokens to fully take advantage of the syntax definition. This is remedied by using a comprehensive color scheme or just tweaking the color scheme you're using, which is incredibly easy to do within the application if you're using an up-to-date installation.***
